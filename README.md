<!-- [**Wan2.2-Lightning: Distill Wan2.2 Family into 4 Steps**] <be> -->


We are excited to release the distilled version of <a href="https://wan.video"><b>Wan2.2</b></a> video generation model family, which offers the following advantages:
- **Fast**: Video generation now requires only 4 steps without the need of CFG trick, leading to x20 speed-up
- **High-quality**: The distilled model delivers visuals on par with the base model in most scenarios, sometimes even better.
- **Complex Motion Generation**: Despite the reduction to just 4 steps, the model retains excellent motion dynamics in the generated scenes.

#### Run Text-to-Video Generation

This repository supports the `Wan2.2-T2V-A14B` Text-to-Video model and can simultaneously support video generation at 480P and 720P resolutions, either portrait or landscape.


##### (1) Without Prompt Extension

To facilitate implementation, we will start with a basic version of the inference process that skips the [prompt extension](#2-using-prompt-extention) step.

- Single-GPU, Single-prompt inference

``` sh
python generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size "1280*720" --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --lora_dir ./Wan2.2-Lightning/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-4steps-lora-rank64-V1 --offload_model True --base_seed 42 --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage."
```

- Single-GPU, Multiple-prompt inference
``` sh
python generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size "1280*720" --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --lora_dir ./Wan2.2-Lightning/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-4steps-lora-rank64-V1 --offload_model True --base_seed 42 --prompt_file examples/prompt_list.txt
```

> ðŸ’¡ This command can run on a GPU with at least 80GB VRAM.

> ðŸ’¡If you encounter OOM (Out-of-Memory) issues, you can use the `--offload_model True`, `--convert_model_dtype` and `--t5_cpu` options to reduce GPU memory usage.


- Multi-GPU inference using FSDP + DeepSpeed Ulysses

  We use [PyTorch FSDP](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html) and [DeepSpeed Ulysses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14509) to accelerate inference.


``` sh
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task t2v-A14B --size "1280*720" --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --base_seed 42 --prompt_file examples/prompt_list.txt
```


##### (2) Using Prompt Extension

Extending the prompts can effectively enrich the details in the generated videos, further enhancing the video quality. Therefore, we recommend enabling prompt extension. We provide the following two methods for prompt extension:

- Use the Dashscope API for extension.
  - Apply for a `dashscope.api_key` in advance ([EN](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/getting-started/first-api-call-to-qwen) | [CN](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/first-api-call-to-qwen)).
  - Configure the environment variable `DASH_API_KEY` to specify the Dashscope API key. For users of Alibaba Cloud's international site, you also need to set the environment variable `DASH_API_URL` to 'https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v1'. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [dashscope document](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/developer-reference/use-qwen-by-calling-api?spm=a2c63.p38356.0.i1).
  - Use the `qwen-plus` model for text-to-video tasks and `qwen-vl-max` for image-to-video tasks.
  - You can modify the model used for extension with the parameter `--prompt_extend_model`. For example:
```sh
DASH_API_KEY=your_key torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage" --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method 'dashscope' --prompt_extend_target_lang 'zh'
```

- Using a local model for extension.

  - By default, the Qwen model on HuggingFace is used for this extension. Users can choose Qwen models or other models based on the available GPU memory size.
  - For text-to-video tasks, you can use models like `Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` and `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`.
  - For image-to-video tasks, you can use models like `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` and `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct`.
  - Larger models generally provide better extension results but require more GPU memory.
  - You can modify the model used for extension with the parameter `--prompt_extend_model` , allowing you to specify either a local model path or a Hugging Face model. For example:

``` sh
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage" --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method 'local_qwen' --prompt_extend_target_lang 'zh'
```


#### Run Image-to-Video Generation

This repository supports the `Wan2.2-I2V-A14B` Image-to-Video model and can simultaneously support video generation at 480P and 720P resolutions.


- Single-GPU inference
```sh
python generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard. The fluffy-furred feline gazes directly at the camera with a relaxed expression. Blurred beach scenery forms the background featuring crystal-clear waters, distant green hills, and a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The cat assumes a naturally relaxed posture, as if savoring the sea breeze and warm sunlight. A close-up shot highlights the feline's intricate details and the refreshing atmosphere of the seaside."
```

> This command can run on a GPU with at least 80GB VRAM.

> ðŸ’¡For the Image-to-Video task, the `size` parameter represents the area of the generated video, with the aspect ratio following that of the original input image.


- Multi-GPU inference using FSDP + DeepSpeed Ulysses

```sh
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard. The fluffy-furred feline gazes directly at the camera with a relaxed expression. Blurred beach scenery forms the background featuring crystal-clear waters, distant green hills, and a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The cat assumes a naturally relaxed posture, as if savoring the sea breeze and warm sunlight. A close-up shot highlights the feline's intricate details and the refreshing atmosphere of the seaside."
```

- Image-to-Video Generation without prompt

```sh
DASH_API_KEY=your_key torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --prompt '' --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method 'dashscope'
```

> ðŸ’¡The model can generate videos solely from the input image. You can use prompt extension to generate prompt from the image.

> The process of prompt extension can be referenced [here](#2-using-prompt-extention).

#### Run Text-Image-to-Video Generation

This repository supports the `Wan2.2-TI2V-5B` Text-Image-to-Video model and can support video generation at 720P resolutions.


- Single-GPU Text-to-Video inference
```sh
python generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size 1280*704 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --t5_cpu --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage"
```

> ðŸ’¡Unlike other tasks, the 720P resolution of the Text-Image-to-Video task is `1280*704` or `704*1280`.

> This command can run on a GPU with at least 24GB VRAM (e.g, RTX 4090 GPU).

> ðŸ’¡If you are running on a GPU with at least 80GB VRAM, you can remove the `--offload_model True`, `--convert_model_dtype` and `--t5_cpu` options to speed up execution.


- Single-GPU Image-to-Video inference
```sh
python generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size 1280*704 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --t5_cpu --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard. The fluffy-furred feline gazes directly at the camera with a relaxed expression. Blurred beach scenery forms the background featuring crystal-clear waters, distant green hills, and a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The cat assumes a naturally relaxed posture, as if savoring the sea breeze and warm sunlight. A close-up shot highlights the feline's intricate details and the refreshing atmosphere of the seaside."
```

> ðŸ’¡If the image parameter is configured, it is an Image-to-Video generation; otherwise, it defaults to a Text-to-Video generation.

> ðŸ’¡Similar to Image-to-Video, the `size` parameter represents the area of the generated video, with the aspect ratio following that of the original input image.

## Introduction of Wan2.2

**Wan2.2** builds on the foundation of Wan2.1 with notable improvements in generation quality and model capability. This upgrade is driven by a series of key technical innovations, mainly including the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, upgraded training data, and high-compression video generation.

##### (1) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture

Wan2.2 introduces Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into the video generation diffusion model. MoE has been widely validated in large language models as an efficient approach to increase total model parameters while keeping inference cost nearly unchanged. In Wan2.2, the A14B model series adopts a two-expert design tailored to the denoising process of diffusion models: a high-noise expert for the early stages, focusing on overall layout; and a low-noise expert for the later stages, refining video details. Each expert model has about 14B parameters, resulting in a total of 27B parameters but only 14B active parameters per step, keeping inference computation and GPU memory nearly unchanged.

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/moe_arch.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;" />
</div>

The transition point between the two experts is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a metric that decreases monotonically as the denoising step $t$ increases. At the beginning of the denoising process, $t$ is large and the noise level is high, so the SNR is at its minimum, denoted as ${SNR}_{min}$. In this stage, the high-noise expert is activated. We define a threshold step ${t}_{moe}$ corresponding to half of the ${SNR}_{min}$, and switch to the low-noise expert when $t<{t}_{moe}$.

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/moe_2.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;" />
</div>

To validate the effectiveness of the MoE architecture, four settings are compared based on their validation loss curves. The baseline **Wan2.1** model does not employ the MoE architecture. Among the MoE-based variants, the **Wan2.1 & High-Noise Expert** reuses the Wan2.1 model as the low-noise expert while uses the  Wan2.2's high-noise expert, while the **Wan2.1 & Low-Noise Expert** uses Wan2.1 as the high-noise expert and employ the Wan2.2's low-noise expert. The **Wan2.2 (MoE)** (our final version) achieves the lowest validation loss, indicating that its generated video distribution is closest to ground-truth and exhibits superior convergence.


##### (2) Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V
To enable more efficient deployment, Wan2.2 also explores a high-compression design. In addition to the 27B MoE models, a 5B dense model, i.e., TI2V-5B, is released. It is supported by a high-compression Wan2.2-VAE, which achieves a $T\times H\times W$ compression ratio of $4\times16\times16$, increasing the overall compression rate to 64 while maintaining high-quality video reconstruction. With an additional patchification layer, the total compression ratio of TI2V-5B reaches $4\times32\times32$. Without specific optimization, TI2V-5B can generate a 5-second 720P video in under 9 minutes on a single consumer-grade GPU, ranking among the fastest 720P@24fps video generation models. This model also natively supports both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks within a single unified framework, covering both academic research and practical applications.
